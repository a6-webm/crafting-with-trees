It may seem like we're crafting with graphs, but we're almost reducing the graph to a tree after removing cyclical crafts (ngl the name is just good)

TODO implement removal of cyclical recipes

TODO implement getting Items from a file or straight from a minecraft instance (which may involve implementing a console interface for picking the preferred recipe)

TODO implement items that don't get used up in crafting

TODO implement starting with resources
