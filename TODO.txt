It may seem like we're crafting with graphs, but we're almost reducing the graph to a tree after removing cyclical crafts (ngl the name is just good)

TODO implement removal of cyclical recipes

TODO implement getting Items from a file or straight from a minecraft instance (which may involve implementing a console interface for picking the preferred recipe)

TODO implement items that don't get used up in crafting (have to add this to the craft graph somehow)

TODO implement starting with resources (ez way is start Craft objects with negative values)

TODO this might throw everything into chaos, but think about recipes with multiple byproducts: e.g. a recipe that uses a bucket of lava will probably return the bucket
